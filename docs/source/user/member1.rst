In this project assignment I was responsible for 3 tables. These tables were people, berber and owner tables. In people table, username and mail are unique so I wrote code by checking these rules.



Signup Flow
-----------

I've created a register type selection page to register a person to the website.
3 different types of records meet client on this page.
When the icons are over, the icon with js rotates and informs about the type of recording.
Clicking Continue button leads to the signup page. (By subject)

   Register Type Page

According to the register type preference, I redirected the client to one of the pages in the image below. On this page I received information from the user in accordance with the type of user, barber and owner. I have written 3 different insert functions to add the incoming information to the tables. Username, mail and tc_number is unique so I checked this values for validation.

Parts Implemented by Ahmet Semih UÃ§an
=====================================

In this project, I created 3 classes to send and receive data as object. My fundamental classes' name are People, Berber and Owner.
In these classes, I write constructors to assign initial values to the object. These classes' codes are below.

Classes
-------

.. code-block:: python

   class People:
    def __init__(self):
        self.id = None
        self.username = None
        self.name_surname = None
        self.mail = None
        self.password_hash = None
        self.gender = None
        self.age = None
        self.role = None
        self.active = True

    def get_id(self):
        return self.username

    @property
    def is_active(self):
        return self.active


.. code-block:: python

    class Berber:
        def __init__(self):
            self.id = None
            self.people_id = None
            self.berber_shop_id = None
            self.gender_choice = None
            self.experience_year = None
            self.start_time = None
            self.finish_time = None
            self.rates = None
            self.people = None #will be used for reaching berber's people attributes for berbershop_view page


.. code-block:: python

    class Owner:
        def __init__(self):
            self.id = None
            self.people_id = None
            self.tc_number = None
            self.serial_number = None
            self.vol_number = None
            self.family_order_no = None
            self.order_no = None

The following initialize function in dbinit.py was running when the site was opened. This function was running to create tables with SQL codes that I kept in the variable INIT_STATEMENT in the database.


.. code-block:: python

    def initialize(url):
        with dbapi2.connect(url) as connection:
            cursor = connection.cursor()
            for statement in INIT_STATEMENTS:
                cursor.execute(statement)
            cursor.close()

INIT_STATEMENT
--------------

.. code-block:: python

    INIT_STATEMENTS = [
    """
        CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS People(
            id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
            username VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE,

            mail VARCHAR(300) UNIQUE,

        """

        )
        """,
        """

            order_no NUMERIC(5)
        )
        """
    ]


In this project, I have written and used sql codes for each table separately, such as deleting updates. I have created 3 different classes named x_model for each table. I wrote the queries I used in the table in these classes. I have completed the necessary actions by calling the functions I prepared in views.py.

People Model
------------

Here are some examples of functions that I use in the model

.. code-block:: python

                people.username, people.name_surname, people.mail, people.password_hash, people.gender, people.age,
                people.role))

        # Read Function
        def get_all_list(self):
            with dbapi2.connect(url) as connection:
                cursor = connection.cursor()
                cursor.execute(""" SELECT * from people""")
                people_list = []
